## Instructions

### Virtualbox

#### Create the virtual machine

* Create a [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VM
	* At least 2 GiB RAM is recommended for using an IDE and a browser at the same time
	* A 20 GB VDI disk should be enough, adjust for your requirements
* Install [Debian 13](https://www.debian.org/)
	* Select `en_US.UTF-8 locale`
	* Set the hostname e.g. *devvm*
	* Create users (or update [`hosts`](hosts))
		* Set root password to `pass`
		* Create `user` with password `pass`
	* Partition disks
		* Select "Guided - use entire disk" and "All files in one partiton" for a simple setup
		* Manually create a single bootable ext4 partition for a swapless setup
	* Software selection - select only `SSH server`
* Prepare the VM for ansible (after booting it for the first time)
	* Update VM network settings in VirtualBox `Settings > Network > Attached to > Bridged Adapter`
	* Log in as root `su -`
	* Restart network service `systemctl restart networking`
	* Get the ip address with `ip a` and update [`hosts`](hosts) in this repository
	* Install sudo and python for Ansible `apt install sudo python3`
	* Add user to sudoers `adduser user sudo`
	* Copy key by SSH-ing into the VM `ssh user@192.168.x.y`
* Setup the VM `ansible-playbook playbooks/setup.yml`
	* Edit `group_vars` to customize your setup

#### Telemetry

* Add telemetry `ansible-playbook playbooks/telemetry.yml`

#### Trim virtual disk

* Remove all unnecessary files `ansible-playbook playbooks/cleanup.yml`
* On VM, run `clear-tmp` and `clear-disk`, then shut it down
* On host, run `vboxmanage modifymedium /mnt/storage/VBOX/phpdev/phpdev.vdi --compact`
	* Edit this path to match your .vdi file

## Updates

It is recommended to run new versions of these playbooks on a fresh Debian install.
However, in most cases, re-running them should work without issues.
