## Instructions

### Virtualbox

#### Create the virtual machine

* Install [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) on a [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VM
	* Create users (or update `hosts`)
		* Set root password to `pass`
		* Create `user` with password `pass`
	* Software selection - select only `SSH server`
* Prepare the VM for ansible
	* Update VM network settings in VirtualBox `Settings > Network > Attached to > Bridged Adapter`
	* Log in as root `su -`
	* Restart network service `systemctl restart networking`
	* Get the ip address with `ip a` and update the `hosts` in this repository
	* Install sudo and python for Ansible `apt install sudo python3`
	* Add user to sudoers `adduser user sudo`
	* Copy key by SSH-ing into the VM `ssh user@192.168.x.y`
* Setup the VM `ansible-playbook playbooks/setup.yml`

#### Trim virtual disk

* Remove all unnecessary files `ansible-playbook playbooks/cleanup.yml`
* On VM, run `clear-disk`, then shut it down
* On host, run `vboxmanage modifymedium /mnt/storage/VBOX/phpdev/phpdev.vdi --compact`
	* Edit this path to match your .vdi file

## Updates

It is recommended to run new versions of these playbooks on a fresh Debian install.
However, in most cases, re-running them should work without issues.
